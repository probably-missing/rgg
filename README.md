# notes (for my sanity)

just stuff i need to keep track of. if people actually are intrested in this garbage of mine, then i'll make an actual readme.

## what happens upon a map being loaded:

1. handler checks if the map exists
2. handler checks if the map handler exists
3. map handler checks if spawn exists
4. map handler spawns player at their team spawn, using data from the handler

## map types:

s& - sandbox
there are no rules!

ud - ultimate destruction
kill as many players as possible before the timer ends or the score cap is reached. nps are usually 1 point, with players being worth 10. these values can be adjusted.
